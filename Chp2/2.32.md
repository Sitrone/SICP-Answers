The set of all subsets of a given set is the union of:

the set of all subsets excluding the first number.
the set of all subsets excluding the first number, with the first number re-inserted into each subset.
Example 1: given the set (3), the first bullet gives the subset (), and the second bullet gives (), (3).

Example 2: given the set (2, 3), the first bullet gives the subsets () and (3). The second bullet gives (2), (2, 3), (), and (3). Note that the first two subsets are the same as the last two subsets with 2 unioned into each subset.

This problem becomes easy when you evolve the process manually:

(subsets '(1 2 3))
rest ← (subsets '(2 3))
       rest ← (subsets '(3))
              rest ← (subsets '())
                     '(())
              (append '(()) (map ⟨…⟩ '(())))
              '(() (3))
       (append '(() (3)) (map ⟨…⟩ '(() (3))))
       '(() (3) (2) (2 3))
(append '(() (3) (2) (2 3)) (map ⟨…⟩ '(() (3) (2) (2 3))))
'(() (3) (2) (2 3) (1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2 3))
The problem now is to find the function (λ (x)) to map, which has the characteristics:

'(())               ⟼ '((3))                     given s = '(3)
'(() (3))           ⟼ '((2) (2 3))               given s = '(2 3)
'(() (3) (2) (2 3)) ⟼ '((1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2 3)) given s = '(1 2 3)
Which is plainly the result of prepending the first item of S to each sublist X; that is, to cons the car of S onto each sublist. In Scheme parlance, (λ (x) (cons (car s) x).
